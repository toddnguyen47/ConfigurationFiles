= VSCode Settings

VSCode settings so you don't have to sync them every time.

== Extensions
It's better to use VSCode's built-in sync settings to sync extensions.

== Directories

For `settings.json` and `keybindings.json`:

* `~/.config/Code/User` for Linux
* `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Code\User` for Windows

For `extensions`:

* `~/.vscode/extensions` for Linux
* `%APPDATA%\Code, %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions` for Windows
